title: L07 Webscraping — Getting to know WGET
tags: [webscraping, regular expressions, wget]
---


# Goals:

Introduction into webscraping, or how one can efficiently collect lots of information from the Internet.


# Software:

* `wget` (<https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/>), a free software package for retrieving files using HTTP, HTTPS, FTP and FTPS the most widely-used Internet protocols. It is a non-interactive command line tool, so it may easily be called from scripts, cron jobs, terminals without X-Windows support, etc.

* **NB**: on installing `wget`:
	* On Windows (the easiest): download from <https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/> > choose the latest 64-bit ZIP file (`EXE` will most likely be blocked by your browser as a potentially dangerous file).
		* Unzip the file and copy `wget.exe` to the folder where you are planning to scrape data; *NB:* the easiest approach on Windows is to move/copy this file into relevant folders. 
	* On Mac (and, possibly, Linux): `brew install wget`


# Class:

* practical examples of working with `wget`
* single link download
* batch download
	* web-page analysis
	* extraction of links with `regular expressions`
	* modification of links with `regular expressions`

# Sample commands

```
wget link
wget -i file_with_links.txt
wget -i links.txt -P ./folderYouWantToSaveTo/ -nc 
```

Where:

* `-P` is a folder parameter, which instructs `wget` where you want to store downloaded files (*optional*).
* `-nc` is a *no-clobber* parameter, which instructs `wget` to skips files, if they already exist (*optional*)

**NB:** there are many other parameters with which you can adjust `wget` to your needs.
