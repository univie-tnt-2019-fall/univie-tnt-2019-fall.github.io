# Goals:

Introduction to “geographical information systems” (GIS) and some of the basics techniques. The focus will be mainly on how one can digitize an image of a map—the process of georeferencing—and extract useful geographical information from it.


# Software:

* QGIS, a Free and Open Source Geographic Information System
(install it from <https://qgis.org/en/site/>) 


# Class:

* Basics of QGIS
* Basics of Georeferencing

# Projection Issues

See, <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_map_projections>.

# A Digital Map: Layers of Goodness

![US_eastStates_03.jpg](/files/QGIS/maps_layers.jpg)

* Layers:
	* Analytical Layer
	* Our Data
	* Annotation/Legend
* Social Geography
	* Political Boundaries
	* Settlements, etc.
* Physical Geography
	* Types of surface
	* Continents / Coastal Line
	* Elevation profile
	* Rivers, Lakes, etc.
* Base Layer: Graticule

# Main Types of Data: Points, Lines, Polygons

* Analytical Layer
	* Our Data
		* Points:
			* item, x**[1]**, point(lat, lon)**[2]**
		* Lines:
			* item, x**[1]**, from(lat, lon)**[2]**, to(lat, lon)**[2]**
		* Polygons:
			* item, x, area(lat, lon; lat, lon; … lat, lon)**[2]**

	* Annotation/Legend

**[1]** where x is a categorical parameter; **[2]** lat/lon: decimal coordinates (not DMS)

# Georeferencing

QGIS must be installed and running. *Note:* Interfaces might differ from system to system; the same applies to different versions of QGIS. Before we proceed, you may want to add Google Layers. To Add Google maps layer: (on the left pane, *Browser*) XYZ > New connection > paste one of the following links (Source:  <https://geogeek.xyz/how-to-add-google-maps-layers-in-qgis-3.html>):

1. **Google Maps**: https://mt1.google.com/vt/lyrs=r&x={x}&y={y}&z={z}
3. **Google Satellite**: http://www.google.cn/maps/vt?lyrs=s@189&gl=cn&x={x}&y={y}&z={z}
4. **Google Satellite Hybrid**: https://mt1.google.com/vt/lyrs=y&x={x}&y={y}&z={z}
5. **Google Terrain**: https://mt1.google.com/vt/lyrs=t&x={x}&y={y}&z={z}
6. **Google Roads**: https://mt1.google.com/vt/lyrs=h&x={x}&y={y}&z={z}

**NB:** Images of maps to work with below

## Step-by-step instructions

* In your `XYZ Tiles`, double click on any Google layer that you added (or on OpenStreetMap)
	* A layer should be added to the main map (see, Layer pane)
* Open Georeferencer: `Raster` > `Georeferencer`
	* if you do not see it there, it must be activated first:
		* `Plugins` > `Manage and Install Plugins...` > [search for *georeferencer*], then tick a box against **Georeferencer GDAL**
* In Georeferencer: `File` > `Open Raster` (also the first button on the main panel)
	* Choose a file. Lets start with *US_eastStates_03.jpg* (this one has a grid, so it will be easier to process)
	* In *Coordinate Reference System Selector*, choose **WGS 84 / Pseudo-Mercator**, then clock `OK`
* Open `Settings` > `Transformation settings` (or click the yellow gears button)
	* Choose settings like on the screenshot below (you can also change `Compression` setting, which will generate a smaller map-image):

* Now, adding georeference points:
![US_eastStates_03.jpg](/files/QGIS/coordinates.png)
	* If you have a grid, it is very easy: just type in coordinates
	* If you don't, it is tricky: you need to find the same features on the image and on the map (for this, click on `From Map Canvas`)
* **[!!!]** Ideally, if you know projection of the map, you only need a few points; this almost never happens, so, the more points you create, the more precisely your image will be georeferenced. This is easy when you have a grid. 
* When you are done with collecting points, click on `PLAY` button (green triangle)
	* The image of your georeferenced map should appear in the main window.
* **[!!!]** Keep in mind that you add layers to your map and a layer on top may cover the layer below!

In general, this procedure can be extremely helpful if:

* you need to collect geographical information from historical maps
* you want to use some historical map as the base layer for mapping your data

## Collecting Point Data (Very Simple Way)

* Create a CSV file; copy/paste the content from below (three lines of text!)

```
city,state,lon,lat,lon1,lat1
New York,New York,-8234229.297,4970380.761,-8234229.297,4970380.761
Philadelphia,Pennsylvania,-8368867.370,4858182.367,-8368867.370,4858182.367
```

* In QGIS, load this file by:
	* `Layer` > `Add Layer` > `Add Delimited Text Layer`
	* Settings should look like on the screenshor below
		* CSV (comma separated format)
		* Point coodinates (X field: `lon`; Y field: `lat`)
		* Geometry CRS: `EPSG:4325 - WGS 84 / Pseudo Mercator`
		* (you will have only two lines of data, instead of five)
		* Make sure to click `Add` when you are done!
![US_eastStates_03.jpg](/files/QGIS/delimitedTextLayer.png)
* The layer is there, but we need to add labels to see the cities
	* Right-click on the layer > Properties
	* On the tab `Labels` change the settings like on the screenshot below
	* Click `Apply`, then `OK`.
![US_eastStates_03.jpg](/files/QGIS/citiesLabels.png)
* You should see two cities now on the map:
	* If nothing appears, try: Right-click on the layer > Set CRS > Set Layer CRS: Choose `WGS 84 / Pseudo-Mercator`
* Now, we can use `Coordinate Capture` plugin to collect data from our georeferenced map:
	* If activated, coordinarte capture should be visible in lower right corner
		* To activate coordinate capture: `Plugins` > `Manage and Install Plugins...` > [search for *coordinate capture*], then tick a box against **Coordinate Capture**
* Collecting coordinates:
	* Keep the initial CSV open in some editor
	* In `Coordinate Capture`, click *Start capture*
		* Click on any point on the map > coordinates of that location will appear in the plugin
		* Click `Copy to Clipboard`
	* Go back to the open CSV:
		* Add a new line:
			* Type the name of the city
			* Add comma and type the name of the state (alternatively, just add another comma)
			* Now, paste what you copied into Clipboard (this will add two sets of coordinates)
		* Save the file
	* Back in QGIS:
		* Switch the layer off and on: after that the newly-added city must appear on the map.
	* Repeat, until all required data is collected.
